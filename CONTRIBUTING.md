## Dev setup

You need:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** `~1.3` or newer — the test runner and dev runtime.
- **Docker** running locally (Engine 20.10+) — for the integration tests against
  real images. Docker Desktop, OrbStack and plain Linux Docker all work; the
  adapter no longer assumes the runtime defines `host.docker.internal` (D-048).
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** — task runner. `brew install just`, or `nix develop` (the flake provides it).
- **[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)** and **`kubectl`** — for the Kubernetes
  suites. `brew install kind kubectl`.

Then:

```sh
bun install
just kind-up      # creates the `cyanotype` kind cluster the k8s recipes default to
```

### Which Kubernetes cluster

The k8s recipes default to kubectl context `kind-cyanotype`, which `just
kind-up` creates. kind is the standard here because continuous integration runs
the Kubernetes adapter suites against it on every pull request, so it is the one
cluster whose behaviour is continuously checked.

Set `CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT` to use a cluster you already have. OrbStack's and
Docker Desktop's built-in clusters need no image copying, because they run
Kubernetes against the same image store as the host Docker daemon — an image
you just built is already visible to them. This document calls those
**shared-image-store clusters**. kind gives each node its own store, so images
must be copied in, which `just test-petstore-k8s` does for you. Nothing
verifies the shared-store clusters automatically, so a break there will be
found by a person rather than by CI.

**Two recipes need a shared-image-store cluster today.** `just
test-petstore-k8s` and `just test-petstore-k8s-attach` are not reliable on kind,
and neither is `just pre-release`, which runs them. Point
`CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT` at OrbStack or Docker Desktop for those three. The
reason, the measurements and the condition for revisiting it are in
[D-049](./docs/decisions.md#d-049-ci-runs-the-kubernetes-adapter-suites-not-the-example--one-port-forward-per-component-is-not-yet-survivable).

The **adapter suites** — `just test-adapter-k8s` and `just
test-adapter-k8s-attach`, which live in `tests/substrate/` and exercise one
adapter directly rather than a whole example environment — drive one component
at a time and are unaffected. They are safe on kind, and are what CI runs.

### Co-developing against a consumer repo via a `file:` pin

If a consumer pins Cyanotype locally — e.g. `"@expelledboy/cyanotype": "file:../../path/to/this-checkout"` — then `bunx @expelledboy/cyanotype derive ...` from the consumer side resolves against the **on-disk `dist/cli/index.js`** of this checkout. The CLI is only emitted by `bun run build` (`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`). Two consequences:

- After changing anything under `src/cli/`, run `bun run build` in this repo before retrying `bunx` from the consumer side. Otherwise `bunx` invokes a stale (or, if `dist/` is absent, fails outright with "could not determine executable").
- After switching a consumer from a `file:` pin to a semver pin (e.g. `^0.3.1`), delete the consumer's `node_modules/@expelledboy/cyanotype` and re-run `bun install` — Bun does not always replace a directory-symlinked dep with a fresh tarball.

Switch to a semver pin once your library change has landed in a published release; that avoids the dist/build coupling entirely.

## Run the tests

```sh
# Type-check.
just typecheck

# Pure unit suite — no Docker, no cluster. Seconds, not minutes; run it constantly.
just test-unit

# Adapter integration against real Docker and Kubernetes.
just test-substrate

# Both harness suites.
just test-core

# Full suite. Teardown runs automatically; back-to-back `bun test` invocations
# don't leak containers.
just test

# Build the test-image dependencies (one time).
just build-test-images

# Manual reset — for unusual situations (kill -9, partial state).
# Not needed on the normal path; the preload handles cleanup.
just clean-containers
```

### How teardown works

`bun test` runs all files in a single process. `bunfig.toml` registers `tests/preload.ts` as a preload script; that file's top-level `afterAll` (from `bun:test`) fires once after the entire run and calls `shared.stopAll()`. The harness stops cached runtimes, then reconnects briefly to force-clean any session-labelled stragglers, then disconnects. No orphan containers remain between runs.

**Docker Compose attach mode is non-destructive and requires manual teardown.** When running `CYANOTYPE_ADAPTER=docker-attach`, Cyanotype never removes the Compose stack's containers — they must be stopped with `docker compose down` when you're done. `just clean-containers` will **not** catch Compose containers because they lack the `cyanotype.substrate=docker` label that the cleanup filter targets.

If you wire your own integration suite for a Cyanotype-based project, you'll need the same pattern:

```ts
// tests/preload.ts
import { afterAll } from "bun:test";
import { shared } from "./your-harness";

// The timeout is not optional: bun:test allows a hook 5s by default, and
// stopping a multi-component environment exceeds that on slower machines.
afterAll(async () => {
  try { await shared.stopAll(); }
  catch (e) { console.error("[preload] stopAll failed:", e); }
}, 120_000);
```

```toml
# bunfig.toml
[test]
preload = ["./tests/preload.ts"]
```

## Making changes

### Code changes

- Follow `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Every implementation module has a test file: `tests/core/<module>.test.ts` for anything testable without a substrate, `tests/substrate/<module>.test.ts` for adapter behaviour that needs a real Docker daemon or cluster. Add tests for new behaviour there.
- The end-to-end example in `tests/petstore-example/` is the integration smoke; if your change affects orchestration or the Adapter SPI, it should still pass.
- `just typecheck` must be clean.
- `just test-unit` must be clean — run it constantly, it takes seconds. It runs
  with runtime invariants enabled (`tests/preload.ts`), so a violated cross-module
  agreement fails there rather than as a confusing symptom later. Set
  `CYANOTYPE_INVARIANTS=1` to enable them outside this repo's suite. Then `just test-core` (adds substrate integration) and `just test` against real Docker.

### Adding a failure mode

Before adding a `throw`, decide whether it is a consumer's mistake (an error,
always on, carrying a `hint`) or an agreement between Cyanotype's own modules
(an `invariant()`, off in consumers' runs). The decision table is in
[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md#failures-invariant-or-error), and
`tests/core/error-classification.test.ts` will fail until the new error is
classified — that is intentional.

### Auditing hints

`just hints` prints every error, the condition that raises it, and the hint the
reader gets. Two automatic layers guard them — `hint-claims.test.ts` fails if a
hint references something that does not exist, `hint-remedies.test.ts` proves
the advice works by performing it — but neither can judge whether prose advice
is *sound*. That is what the catalogue is for: read it against the code when
touching error paths, and when adding a hint you cannot prove, phrase it as
something to check rather than a remedy to follow.

### Architectural changes

Anything that touches a load-bearing concept (Blueprint shape, Adapter SPI, Environment composition, cross-process registry, event-bus typing) needs an ADR in `docs/decisions.md`.

The ADR process:

1. Open a draft PR with the change.
2. Add an entry to `docs/decisions.md` at the end. Format:
   ```
   ## D-NNN. Title

   **Context:** Why this came up.
   **Decision:** What we're doing.
   **Consequences:** What this enables, breaks, or forecloses.
   ```
3. The decisions file is **append-only**. Never edit an existing ADR. If a decision is wrong, add a new ADR that explicitly retires the old one — don't rewrite history.

### What to do when stuck

- **Spec ambiguous?** Stop and ask. Don't pick between two reasonable interpretations silently — that's how the project drifts.
- **Test would need a non-trivial fake?** Stop and ask. It's a design smell — the abstraction may need to move.
- **A module heading past 200 LoC?** Stop and ask. Either the module is eating a neighbour's job or the design is wrong.

## PR shape

- One concern per PR. If you're adding a feature and refactoring, split them.
- The PR description states the *why*: what problem this solves, what the alternatives were, what's now possible (or impossible). The diff explains the *what*.
- Tests in the same PR as the change.
- If you added an ADR, link to it from the PR description.

## Pre-release checklist

Tags go on `master`, never on a branch: CI runs only on pull requests, so a
tag on an unmerged branch publishes code no CI has validated. Land the release
prep in the PR, merge, then tag `master`. The full cycle and the checks the
automation does not perform are in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md#releasing).

Before tagging any `v*.*.*` and triggering `release.yml`, run:

```sh
just pre-release
```

It is a gate, not a list: silent and exit 0 when the tree is releasable,
otherwise every failing check between two `[GATE]` lines. It covers git state,
the CHANGELOG section the release workflow will look for, the lockfile, lint,
typecheck, build, the core tests, the adapter suites, the package contents, the
petstore example against all five substrates, and container leaks — and it tags
nothing.

It is a **strict superset of CI**, deliberately. Everything the pull-request
workflow runs, this runs too, plus what only a release cares about: git state,
tag availability, the built command-line interface, and the two Kubernetes
petstore paths the workflow cannot run at all. So a green CI is necessary and
not sufficient, and the difference between them is exactly the release-shaped
risk.

It runs every suite with `CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_DOCKER` and `CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_K8S`
set, which turn an absent substrate into a failure rather than a skip. A release
bar that quietly drops the suites it could not run is not a bar. Point
`CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT` at a shared-image-store cluster before running it — see
"Which Kubernetes cluster" above.

It also smokes the built CLI, which is the one check with a story behind it:
`tests/core/cli-derive.test.ts` covers `deriveCompose` and `deriveK8s` as pure
functions, so nothing there catches argv parsing or subcommand routing, and
0.3.0 shipped a broken dispatcher for exactly that reason. The gate runs
`dist/cli/index.js` for real and asserts on what it emits, including that
misuse exits 2 — a dispatcher bug shows up as accepting bad input rather than
as wrong output.
