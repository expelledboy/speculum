# petstore-sla — worked example

A realistic three-tier topology used as Cyanotype's use-site validation **and** as the canonical demo of what the harness is for.

```
client → nginx (round-robin) → 3× petstore → redis primary
                                            ↘ redis replica (reads)
```

## Layout

| File | What it shows | Axiom |
|---|---|---|
| `env.ts` | Blueprint + Binding definitions + environment composition | A1, A2, B2, B3 |
| `harness.ts` | `createSharedEnvs` + adapter wiring | B1, C1 |
| `lifecycle.test.ts` | Test owns container lifecycle; typed multi-instance paths | B1, B3, C2 |
| `typed-api.test.ts` | Schema-driven typed clients; drift = compile error | A1 |
| `typed-events.test.ts` | `waitFor` on typed event attributes | A2 |
| `state-consistency.test.ts` | Replication seen via per-instance addressing | B3 |
| `resilience.test.ts` | Chaos: `chaos.stop` mid-test; SLA degrades gracefully | C2 |
| `sla.test.ts` | Quantitative availability + p95 latency targets | A1, B3, C2 |

Each suite header maps explicitly to entries in [`docs/axioms.md`](../../docs/axioms.md). If you delete a suite, you should be able to point to the axiom that suite was protecting.

## Running

The suites use the real Docker adapter by default. Build the container images once before running:

```sh
just build-test-images
```

Then `bun test tests/petstore-example/`. Runs on any Docker runtime: petstore reaches the host-bound redis via `host.docker.internal`, which the adapter maps to the bridge gateway on every container it creates (D-048).

## Substrates

All five `CYANOTYPE_ADAPTER` values are supported. Prerequisites per substrate:

| Adapter | Prerequisite |
|---|---|
| `docker` | Docker running; images built (`just build-test-images`). |
| `docker-attach` | A running Compose stack, plus `derived-compose.json` — the topology file `cyanotype derive compose` writes next to `env.ts`, mapping each component to its published host port. `just test-petstore-docker-attach` brings the stack up, generates the file, runs, and tears down. |
| `memory` | None — runs entirely in-process with no Docker images required. |
| `k8s` | Any cluster — `just test-petstore-k8s` builds, copies the images in, and deploys automatically. Point `CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT` at a cluster sharing the host's image store (OrbStack, Docker Desktop); this suite is not reliable on kind ([D-049](../../docs/decisions.md#d-049-ci-runs-the-kubernetes-adapter-suites-not-the-example--one-port-forward-per-component-is-not-yet-survivable)). |
| `k8s-attach` | A reachable cluster. You do not deploy the fixture stack yourself: `just test-petstore-k8s-attach` applies it, derives the topology, runs, and deletes the namespace. |
