/**
 * Gate: every upstream image this run needs is present locally, under the name
 * the fixtures already use.
 *
 * Pulls each image from the mirror in `tests/support/images.json` and retags it
 * to its original name. Nothing downstream knows the mirror exists — the
 * Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests and Compose files keep the references they
 * already had, so CI and a laptop run identical strings.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST PULL FROM DOCKER HUB. Anonymous pulls are capped at 100 per six
 * hours per IPv4 address, and GitHub's hosted runners share addresses with
 * every other tenant. Our own six pulls per run are irrelevant to that budget;
 * somebody else's exhaust it. Pulling from a registry with no such cap removes
 * the dependency rather than shrinking it.
 *
 * FALLS BACK TO THE SOURCE. A missing mirror tag is not fatal: the image is
 * pulled from its original registry instead and the run continues, degraded to
 * the rate limit it was trying to avoid. That is deliberate — the mirror exists
 * to remove a flake, and a mirror outage that HARD-FAILED every build would be
 * a worse flake than the one it prevents. The fallback is reported, so a
 * silently-empty mirror shows up as noise rather than as nothing.
 *
 * Gate contract: silent and exit 0 when every image is present; otherwise the
 * whole story between two `[GATE]` lines and a non-zero exit.
