/**
 * Copy every image in `tests/support/images.json` from its source registry to
 * this repository's GitHub Container Registry namespace, and record what was
 * copied.
 *
 * Run by `.github/workflows/mirror-images.yml`, monthly. Not a gate: it prints
 * what it did, because a human reads the resulting diff to see whether a
 * floating upstream tag moved.
 *
 * IT COPIES ONE ARCHITECTURE. `docker pull` here resolves the source manifest
 * list to this runner's platform, and `docker push` publishes that single
 * image — so the mirror holds linux/amd64 and nothing else. Every consumer of
 * the mirror inherits that constraint, which is why `scripts/prime-images.ts`
 * refuses to run elsewhere rather than silently retagging an amd64 image over
 * a working local one.
 *
 * The recorded `id` is the image CONFIG digest, which survives being copied
 * between registries — the manifest digest does not, so it could not verify
 * anything on the far side. Being a config digest it is platform-specific,
 * which is consistent with the artifacts rather than a separate limitation.
