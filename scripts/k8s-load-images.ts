/**
 * Make this repository's locally built images visible to the Kubernetes
 * cluster the suites are about to run against.
 *
 * WHETHER THAT NEEDS DOING AT ALL DEPENDS ON THE CLUSTER, which is the whole
 * reason this is a script. OrbStack and Docker Desktop run Kubernetes against
 * the same image store as the host Docker daemon, so an image you just built
 * is already there and copying it would be a no-op. kind gives each node its
 * own containerd store, so an image that is not copied in is simply absent —
 * and because the manifests set `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`, absent means
 * the kubelet tries to pull `cyanotype/petstore-sla:latest` from a registry
 * that has never heard of it.
 *
 * WHAT THAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT THIS SCRIPT, measured on kind: the Pod
 * sits in `Pending`, the adapter waits out its readiness budget, and sixty
 * seconds later it raises `k8s_pod_not_ready` naming the Pod. Every word of
 * that is true and none of it says "the image was never loaded". A named
 * refusal here, before anything is deployed, costs a second instead.
 *
 * DETECTION IS BY CONTEXT NAME, which is a heuristic and is why the override
 * exists. It is a sound one for the three cases it names: kind always prefixes
 * its contexts with `kind-`, and the two shared-store runtimes have fixed
 * context names. Anything else refuses rather than guessing, because guessing
 * wrong here is the sixty-second mystery above.
 *
 * K3D AND MINIKUBE ARE ABSENT ON PURPOSE, and k3d is not a hypothetical: it
 * was built, loaded and run against this suite on two platforms while choosing
 * a cluster for continuous integration, and it measured the same as kind
 * (D-049). Supporting it here would mean shipping a branch nobody exercises,
 * whose first failure would be in front of a stranger. The refusal below tells
 * such a user exactly which override to set, which is a better trade than a
 * guess we cannot back.
 *
 * Refusal follows the repository's gate contract: silent and exit 0 when the
 * cluster can see the images, otherwise the whole story between two `[GATE]`
 * lines and a non-zero exit.
