/**
 * Gate: is this tree releasable?
 *
 * The pre-release checklist in AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md, executed instead
 * of read. Silent on stdout and exit 0 when everything holds; on a miss, every
 * failing check between two `[GATE]` lines and a non-zero exit. Progress goes
 * to stderr so a five-minute run is not a blank screen.
 *
 * It refuses rather than skips. If Docker or the cluster is unreachable, the
 * substrate suites have not run, and a release bar that quietly drops them is
 * not a bar. Nothing here is opt-out for that reason, which is why every suite
 * below runs with CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_DOCKER and CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_K8S set: those
 * turn an absent substrate into a failure rather than a skip.
 *
 * IT IS A STRICT SUPERSET OF CI, deliberately. Everything the pull-request
 * workflow runs, this runs too, plus the things only a release cares about —
 * git state, tag availability, the CHANGELOG section the release workflow will
 * extract, the built command-line interface, and the petstore example against
 * all five substrates. Two of those the workflow cannot cover at all: the
 * Kubernetes example paths, for the reason below.
 *
 * POINT CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT AT A SHARED-IMAGE-STORE CLUSTER (OrbStack,
 * Docker Desktop) BEFORE RUNNING THIS. The petstore example's Kubernetes paths
 * are not reliable on the default kind cluster — D-049 in docs/decisions.md —
 * so this gate would otherwise fail intermittently for a reason that has
 * nothing to do with the release.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: tag, push, or publish. It answers "may
 * this be released", not "release it".
