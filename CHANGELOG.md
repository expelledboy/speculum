## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **A project using zod 4 could not compile against this package.** `zod` was a
  normal dependency pinned to `^3`, so a consumer on zod 4 got a second, nested
  zod 3 installed underneath us. Their `z.object(...)` then failed to satisfy
  our `ZodTypeAny`, which resolved to that nested copy —
  `TS2345: … is not assignable to parameter of type 'HttpRouteMap'`.

  `zod` is now a **peer dependency** with the range `^3.23.0 || ^4.0.0`, so the
  consumer's copy is the only copy and our published types resolve against it.
  Both majors are verified on every commit. npm 7+ and Bun install missing peer
  dependencies automatically; if your package manager does not, add `zod` to
  your own dependencies.

  This is what v0.7.1's declaration change was aiming at and did not reach. That
  release made the emitted `.d.ts` text independent of the zod major, which was
  necessary but not sufficient — the types still bound to whichever zod sat
  nearest the declaration file.

- **The published declarations referenced Bun's types.** `dist/adapters/kubectl.d.ts`
  declared `import type { Subprocess } from "bun"`, and `@types/bun` is a
  development dependency here. Any consumer compiling with `skipLibCheck: false`
  failed with `TS2307: Cannot find module 'bun'` on a type they never used —
  contradicting this package's claim to be usable from Node. The consumed
  surface is now declared locally as `SpawnedProcess`, the way the Docker
  adapter already handles dockerode without `@types/dockerode`.

### Added

- `just consumer-types` builds the package as npm would and compiles a real
  consumer against it, once per zod major in the peer range, with
  `skipLibCheck: false`. It runs in CI and in `just pre-release`. Both defects
  above were invisible to every existing suite, because those run inside this
  repository's own `node_modules` where zod resolves to one copy and
  `@types/bun` is always installed.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- The two exported adapter-config schemas, `K8sAdapterConfigSchema` and
  `ComposeAdapterConfigSchema`, are now declared as `z.ZodType<T>` rather than
  letting TypeScript infer `z.ZodObject<...>`. The emitted `.d.ts` names `zod`
  by module specifier, so it resolves against the zod copy in the CONSUMER's
  project — and the inferred form embedded zod's own generic arity, which
  differs between majors (`ZodObject<Shape, "strip", ZodTypeAny, Output, Input>`
  in zod 3, `ZodObject<Shape, $strip>` in zod 4). A consumer whose zod resolved
  to a different major than this package was built against therefore saw type
  errors on those two constants. The public declarations are now byte-identical
  whether built against zod 3.25.76 or zod 4.x, and `zod` stays a `^3.23.0`
  dependency for now.

  Two new exported types come with it, `K8sAdapterConfig` and
  `ComposeAdapterConfig`, naming the shapes those schemas validate.

  **Narrowing, so worth checking if you use it:** `z.ZodType<T>` does not carry
  `.shape` or `.extend()`. Code calling either on those two exported constants
  will no longer compile. Nothing in this repository did.

- The published declarations are now emitted by TypeScript 7 rather than 5.9.
  Nothing in the public API changed meaning; the only observable difference is
  ordering, where property and union-member order shifted in the `.d.ts` text
  (`"ignore" | "warn" | "fail"` now prints as `"fail" | "ignore" | "warn"`).
  Union member order does not affect type identity or assignability.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- The Docker adapter now creates containers with
  `host.docker.internal:host-gateway`, instead of assuming the runtime defines
  that name. Docker Desktop and OrbStack do; plain Linux Docker does not, so
  every Binding wiring its neighbours through that name — including the
  reference example — failed readiness on Linux with a 30-second
  `probe_timeout` naming a container that was running correctly and could not
  resolve its neighbours. Requires Docker Engine 20.10+ ([D-048](docs/decisions.md#d-048-the-docker-adapter-asks-for-hostdockerinternal-it-no-longer-assumes-the-runtime-defines-it)).

### Development

- **Continuous integration now runs every substrate, and fails when one is
  missing.** It previously ran `tests/core/` and `tests/substrate/` in a single
  job on a runner with Docker and no cluster, so the two Kubernetes suites
  contributed 22 tests that executed no assertions and reported as passes,
  while the petstore example — the suite proving all five adapters behave
  alike — ran nowhere at all. Three parallel jobs now cover unit, Docker and
  Kubernetes in about two minutes.

- **A suite that cannot reach its substrate reports `skip`, not `pass`.** The
  availability probe moved out of `beforeAll`, which Bun runs after test
  registration and therefore too late to inform `describe.skipIf`. Gating is
  per describe-block, because two files mix pure and substrate-dependent
  blocks. `CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_DOCKER=1` and `CYANOTYPE_REQUIRE_K8S=1` turn an
  absent substrate into a failure instead; continuous integration sets both,
  since it provisions them first and their absence would mean the provisioning
  step silently did nothing.

- **kind is the standard local cluster**, created by `just kind-up` and
  defaulted to by every Kubernetes recipe. `load-k8s-images` used to print that
  images needed no copying and copy nothing — true for OrbStack and Docker
  Desktop, which share their image store, and false for kind, where it produced
  a sixty-second Pod-scheduling timeout that never mentioned images.
  `scripts/k8s-load-images.ts` detects which loader a cluster needs and refuses
  by name when it cannot tell.

- **The petstore example's two Kubernetes paths are not run by continuous
  integration** and are not reliable on kind. The adapter opens one `kubectl
  port-forward` per component and cannot yet recover one that dies after
  establishing. Point `CYANOTYPE_K8S_CONTEXT` at OrbStack or Docker Desktop for
  those, and for `just pre-release`, which runs them
  ([D-049](docs/decisions.md#d-049-ci-runs-the-kubernetes-adapter-suites-not-the-example--one-port-forward-per-component-is-not-yet-survivable)).

- **`just pre-release` is now a strict superset of continuous integration.** It
  previously omitted `tests/substrate/` and the package-contents check
  entirely, making it disjoint from CI rather than stricter — passing both was
  the only real coverage anyone had, and nothing said so.

- **The six upstream images are mirrored monthly to GitHub Container Registry**
  and retagged to their original names before any suite runs, so no Dockerfile,
  manifest or fixture knows the mirror exists. Anonymous Docker Hub pulls are
  capped per IP address and GitHub's runners share addresses with every other
  tenant, so the fix is to remove the dependency rather than shrink it. The
  mirror is linux/amd64 only and priming refuses to run elsewhere.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-31

### Changed (BREAKING)

- `attachEnvironment` now runs the Blueprint's `readiness` probe before
  returning a runtime, matching `startEnvironment`. `adapter.exists()` proves a
  container is present, not that it serves, and attach is the default path —
  any already-running Compose or Kubernetes stack, and every parallel test
  worker after the first one to start the environment.
  A failing probe throws `{ kind: "attach_probe_failed", componentName,
  instanceId, cause }`. A suite that previously raced ahead of a slow component
  may now report a real environment failure. See D-036.
- `EventBus.waitFor` and `expectSequence` match only events ingested after the
  call; they no longer scan the whole retained buffer. A shared environment
  outlives a single test, so the old default let an earlier test's event
  satisfy a later assertion. Pass `{ after: FROM_START }` (or the new
  `bus.mark()` checkpoint) to widen the window. `collect()`'s default is
  unchanged — it still returns the whole buffer. See D-037.
- `HttpRoute` is now discriminated on both `method` and `responseMode`, so a
  schema only compiles where the client can actually reach it. `request` on a
  GET or DELETE, and `response` or `errorResponse` on a route whose
  `responseMode` never parses a body, were all previously accepted and then
  silently ignored at runtime. Specifically: `status` mode reaches neither
  response schema, `raw` mode reaches `errorResponse` but not `response`, and
  `json` mode (the default) reaches both.

### Changed

- A component's Kubernetes `Service` now selects the binding
  (`cyanotype.component` + `cyanotype.instance`, session-scoped) rather than a
  single pod, so it survives pod replacement. `chaos.stop` consequently deletes
  the pod and leaves the Service standing: a dead pod behind a live Service is
  what production produces, and deleting the address alongside the process was
  a compound fault that no real failure mode creates. See D-039.

### Added

- Attach now resolves a **component**, not a container id, for adapters that
  implement `reconnect`. A chaos restart in the process that owns an
  environment replaces containers without updating the shared metadata, so an
  attaching worker held names that no longer existed — measured at three of six
  after one run of the reference suite — and was rejected with `container_gone`
  despite every component being healthy. The Kubernetes adapter now resolves
  `cyanotype.env` + component + instance. No SPI change. See D-047.
- `Adapter.reconnect` — one optional SPI method, for adapters whose reported
  ports do not outlive the process that opened them. Kubernetes deploy mode
  reports `kubectl port-forward` locals, so a second process attaching from
  persisted metadata previously found closed ports and spent its whole
  readiness budget on them (measured: 30.5s and a failure). With it, the
  reference example warm-attaches in ~2.0s against 10.6s cold. Adapters that
  omit it are unaffected. See D-046.
- Three layers keeping hints honest, because a hint that lies is worse than no
  hint: a claim lint that fails the build when a hint references something that
  does not exist, remedy tests that trigger an error and then perform its hint's
  advice to prove it resolves, and `just hints` — a rendered catalogue of every
  error, its trigger and its hint — for the soundness review neither can
  automate. See D-045.
- Consumer-facing errors carry a `hint` explaining what was done, why it is
  wrong, and the fix. An audit of all 62 thrown kinds against their guard
  conditions put 54 in that category and 8 as internal: a test harness is
  almost entirely a boundary onto someone else's system, so the failures it
  raises are overwhelmingly theirs to act on — the image will not pull, the pod
  will not schedule, the service never becomes ready, kubectl is missing,
  credentials lack a verb. `probe_timeout` and `image_not_registered` are among
  those that previously offered nothing. Enforced by
  `tests/core/error-classification.test.ts`, which fails if any thrown error is
  unclassified, if a consumer-facing one lacks a hint, if an internal one has
  one, or if a hint references this repository's own tooling. See D-043, D-044.
- Runtime invariants for cross-module agreements the type system cannot state —
  `invariant()` in `src/invariants.ts`, eleven of them across the orchestrator,
  registry, event bus and adapters. Off unless `CYANOTYPE_INVARIANTS=1`, so a
  consumer pays nothing and is never interrupted by a check on Cyanotype's
  internals; on for this repository's own suite. See D-042.
- `SharedOptions.startup` / `OrchestratorOptions.startup` accept `"concurrent"`
  to start every component slot at once instead of one at a time, making
  startup the length of the longest dependency chain rather than the sum of
  every slot's readiness. Defaults to `"sequential"`; opt in when your
  components retry their dependencies. See D-040.

- Persisted environment metadata records the substrate that produced it
  (`EnvironmentMetadata.adapter`). Switching `CYANOTYPE_ADAPTER` between runs
  used to leave a state file the next adapter could not interpret; it survived
  only because `exists()` happened to reject the foreign container ids.
  `startOrAttach` now rebuilds explicitly, and `attach` throws
  `attach_substrate_mismatch` instead of the misleading `attach_dead_container`.
  Optional and additive — metadata without the field is attached as before.
  See D-041.

- `bus.mark(): EventCheckpoint` and `waitFor(name, { after })` /
  `expectSequence(names, timeoutMs, { after })` for explicit subscription offsets,
  plus the exported `FROM_START` checkpoint. The underlying sequence counter is
  monotonic and survives `clear()`, so a checkpoint taken before a chaos
  restart stays in the past instead of addressing an unrelated event.
- `wait_for_timeout` carries `after` and `beforeCheckpoint`, separating "never
  emitted" from "emitted before you waited".
- `EventWindow` (`{ after }`) is the search bound for `expectSequence` and
  `collect`, which have no filter object to carry it. `after` therefore means
  the same thing and is spelled the same way on all three calls.
- `SharedOptions.attachReadinessTimeoutMs` caps the TOTAL time spent probing
  readiness on attach. Attach probes components one at a time, so the worst
  case is otherwise the sum of every Blueprint's own probe timeout. Opt-in:
  omitted, each Blueprint's `timeoutMs` is honoured in full.
- `HttpErrorShape` is exported, giving the thrown `http_error` a name.
- `HttpRoute.errorResponse` — an optional schema for non-2xx bodies. Success
  bodies were Zod-checked while error bodies crossed the boundary unvalidated.
  A body that violates the schema keeps its raw value and reports
  `errorSchemaIssues` rather than being reshaped.
- `createCompositeAdapter({ default, routes })` lets one Environment span more
  than one substrate — the component under test running for real while its
  dependencies are simulated. Routes key on component name or
  `component.instance`, so a real "stable" instance and a simulated "canary"
  instance of the *same* component can coexist. Realization is fixed at harness
  construction and cannot be changed from a test. See D-038.
- `just check-no-leaks` is a gate: silent and exit 0 when clean, and on failure
  it names the surviving containers and exits non-zero.

### Fixed

- A chaos stop that the adapter REFUSES no longer kills the component's event
  stream. `chaos.stop` aborted the log-stream signal before calling
  `adapter.stop()`, so when the stop threw — `chaos_unsupported_in_attach_mode`
  is the live case, made a loud throw deliberately — the container kept running
  with a permanently closed stream. Only `chaos.start` re-arms it, and nobody
  calls start after a stop that was refused, so every later `waitFor` on that
  component timed out blaming the component rather than the refusal. The abort
  now happens after the stop succeeds.
- `invariant()` no longer evaluates its condition when invariants are disabled.
  `held` was a plain parameter, so JavaScript ran it at the call site
  regardless: consumers paid for every condition, and one that dereferenced
  something absent threw `undefined is not an object` — a disabled check
  crashing a consumer with a message about Cyanotype's internals. Both
  arguments are thunks now. See D-043.
- A Binding that omits one of its Blueprint's declared `portNames` is rejected
  by `createEnvironment` with `binding_missing_declared_ports`, naming the
  component, instance and missing port. It previously type-checked (
  `Binding.ports` is not keyed to `portNames`), resolved to `undefined` inside
  the interface URI, and surfaced as a readiness timeout apparently against the
  consumer's own service. See D-043.
- The Kubernetes attach-mode reconnection layer no longer orphans a `kubectl
  port-forward` child on every chaos cycle. `resume()` published the new child
  only after clearing its `paused` flag, so the supervisor could wake, observe
  the dead child as already exited, and race into its own respawn while
  `resume` was spawning — leaving a process nothing held a reference to.
  Measured on the k8s-attach petstore suite across three independent pairs of
  runs: 2/2/4 orphaned processes before, 0/0/0 after.
- The `cyanotype.session` label is now stamped by the adapter, which is what
  `teardown()` sweeps by. Previously `createSharedEnvs` supplied
  `${process.pid}-${Date.now()}` recomputed per call — so the label meant to
  group a session was unique per container — while teardown selected on the
  adapter's own id, leaving D-016's label-scan backstop unable to match
  anything. Found by the invariant above on its first run against real
  containers. See D-042.
- `waitFor` in the reference example records its trajectory — attempts, elapsed
  time and a sample of what the predicate observed — so a timeout distinguishes
  "never came close" from "recovering, just not inside the budget".
- The reference fixture no longer trusts `REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT` blindly.
  Kubernetes injects `<SERVICE_NAME>_PORT=tcp://<ip>:<port>` into every pod for
  every Service in the namespace, so a `redis-primary` Service silently
  replaced that variable with a URL; `Number()` yielded `NaN` and the container
  died at module load. Anyone whose environment variable names collide with
  Service names needs the same guard. See D-039.

- Events ingested by the orchestrator now carry `instance` on the event object
  itself, alongside `component` and `occurredAt`.
  `EventFilter.instance` was a public filter that could never match in a real
  environment: both `ingest` call sites had the instance in scope and dropped
  it, so the field only worked in unit tests that called the bus directly.
  Multi-instance suites that worked around this by logging the instance into
  event *attributes* can now filter on the event's own `instance` field
  instead: `waitFor("NAME", { instance: "primary" })`.
- A failed attach now shuts down the log-follow streams of every component
  attached so far. Previously attach could only fail before those streams
  started, so nothing needed closing; adding the readiness probe above
  introduced a failure point after they open.
- Container cleanup is scoped to the substrate that created it. Both adapters
  stamped `cyanotype=1` and `cyanotype.session`, and the Kubernetes adapter puts
  them on Pod metadata — so where one container runtime is shared between Docker
  and Kubernetes (OrbStack, Docker Desktop), the leak check counted Pod
  sandboxes as leaked Docker containers, and `just clean-containers` could
  `docker rm -f` live Pods. Each adapter now stamps `cyanotype.substrate`, and
  the Docker teardown scan, `clean-containers` and the leak check all filter on
  it. Containers created before this labelling need clearing once by hand with
  `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq --filter label=cyanotype=1)`.

### Development

- `tests/core/` is now the pure unit suite — no Docker, no cluster, ~6s — and
  the six adapter-integration files moved to `tests/substrate/`. `just
  test-unit` runs the fast suite for the inner loop, `just test-substrate` the
  integration one, `just test-core` both. `npm test` and `prepublishOnly` run
  both, so continuous integration coverage is unchanged.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-12

### Changed (BREAKING)
- Package identity is now `@expelledboy/cyanotype` (was published under the
  previous scoped name through 0.4.x). CLI bin is `cyanotype`. Consumers must
  re-pin the dependency and invoke the new bin.
- Runtime wire labels, env vars, and on-disk state use the `cyanotype` /
  `CYANOTYPE_*` / `.cyanotype-env` vocabulary end-to-end (orchestrator writers,
  Docker/K8s readers and guards, derive, fixtures). No dual-read of prior
  label keys — attach targets and teardown filters must carry
  `cyanotype=1` / `cyanotype.component` / `cyanotype.session` (and related)
  labels. Test images are tagged under `cyanotype/…`.
- GitHub repository slug in package metadata points at
  `expelledboy/cyanotype` (remote rename is a separate ops step).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Docker adapter `logs()` now passes `tail: 0` to dockerode so follow
  streams start at the live end only. Matches Kubernetes
  (`kubectl logs -f --tail=0`). Previously dockerode replaying full
  container history on attach could allocate multi‑GiB in the test process
  when an operator had left a verbose compose stack up. Deploy-mode live
  lines are unchanged.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-02

Multi-port attach DX fix. Surfaced by a consumer (BRT) migrating to a
six-leg compose stack with two multi-port simulator services; their
hand-rolled `MULTI_PORT_ATTACH_KEYS` workaround stripped `attach.port`
from derive output so the binding's `spec.ports` could drive
resolution. The library now does this automatically.

### Fixed
- `deriveCompose` and `deriveK8s` emit `attach.port` only when the
  underlying compose service or k8s workload publishes exactly one
  container port. Multi-port services / workloads omit the field —
  the binding's `spec.ports` then drives full multi-port resolution
  via the adapter's existing fallback path
  (`override?.port !== undefined ? [...] : Object.keys(spec.ports)`).
  Previously derive auto-emitted the first declared port for every
  service, which silently disabled resolution for ports 2..N of any
  multi-port binding. (D-035)

### Docs
- `docs/attach-mode.md` per-field semantics table for
  `compose.attach.*` reframes `port`'s polarity — set means "narrow
  single-port override that ignores `spec.ports`"; absent means
  "resolve every `spec.ports` key, the correct default for multi-port
  services". Adds a "Multi-port attach services" subsection working
  through the override-by-extension pattern at the bind site.
- The same schema block now lists `onImageDrift` (added in D-028,
  D-032) alongside `allowChaos` — the previous omission was a
  documentation oversight, not a missing feature.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-29

Container ownership becomes a first-class SPI property; derive emits
topology only. Closes a defect where end-of-session `stopAll` could
`docker stop` an operator's attached compose stack. Surfaced by the
first consumer (BRT) adopting 0.3.1 in production.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **`Started` SPI return now requires `owned: boolean`.** External adapter
  implementers must set it; Cyanotype uses it to distinguish containers it
  created from containers it merely attached to. (D-034)
- **`cyanotype derive compose|k8s` no longer emits `allowChaos` in derived
  output.** Derived adapter config carries topology only (project / service /
  port / namespace / deployment). Policy fields — `allowChaos`, `onImageDrift`
  — belong at the bind site, where the test author explicitly opts in per
  binding. Consumers that rely on chaos in attach mode must spread
  `allowChaos: true` into the adapter config at `bind()` time. (D-033)
- **Docker adapter `stop()` in attach mode now throws
  `chaos_unsupported_in_attach_mode` when `allowChaos` is unset**, mirroring
  the existing K8s adapter behaviour. The previous silent no-op masked
  misconfigured bindings. (D-034)

### Fixed
- `runtime.stop()` and `shared.stopAll()` no longer call `adapter.stop()` for
  containers Cyanotype did not create (`owned: false`). Closes a defect where
  attach-mode + `allowChaos: true` caused end-of-session `stopAll` to
  `docker stop` the operator's running stack. (D-034)
- Version-drift invalidation (`stopAllInMeta`) skips non-owned containers.
  Pure-attach mode continues to throw `attach_version_stale` as before. (D-034)

### Added
- `ComponentSnapshot` gains optional `owned?: boolean`; absent is treated as
  `true` for backward compatibility with pre-0.4.0 metadata files. (D-034)

### Docs
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains a Pre-release checklist that names the CLI
  spawn suite as the regression bar for `bin` dispatcher bugs, with a
  manual smoke-test snippet that exercises both `derive compose` and
  `derive k8s` from the built `dist/`. Documents the surprise from
  0.3.0 — library tests passed; the bin entry was broken.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` gains a "Co-developing against a consumer repo via
  a `file:` pin" note: contributors must `bun run build` after any
  `src/cli/` change for the consumer's `bunx @expelledboy/cyanotype …`
  to see it, and a consumer switching from a `file:` to a semver pin
  should `rm -rf node_modules/@expelledboy/cyanotype && bun install`.
- `docs/attach-mode.md` troubleshooting table gains rows for
  `attach_dead_container` and `container_gone`, plus an "Upgrading
  from a pre-0.3.0 attach session" subsection that explains why
  bumping `Binding.version` does not dislodge a legacy snapshot
  (absent stored version → check is deliberately skipped, see D-027)
  and prescribes the one-time `rm .cyanotype-env/<envKey>.json` fix.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-28

Bugfix for the 0.3.0 `cyanotype derive` CLI and package-root re-exports.
Reported by the first consumer to adopt 0.3.0 against a real
`docker compose` stack; no library-API changes.

### Fixed
- `src/cli/index.ts` dispatched on the wrong argv token: after
  `const [cmd, sub, mode] = argv`, the third token of
  `derive compose --compose <path>` is `--compose`, not `compose`, so
  `if (mode === "compose")` was never true and every invocation fell
  through to "error: --k8s is required". Now branches on `sub`; the
  unused `mode` token is removed. A new test suite spawns the bin entry
  end-to-end (`tests/core/cli-derive.test.ts`) so future argv-parsing
  breakage at the dispatch level cannot ship green.
- `deriveCompose` and `deriveK8s` are now exported from
  `@expelledboy/cyanotype`. In 0.3.0 they were only reachable through
  the deep path `@expelledboy/cyanotype/dist/cli/derive.js` — not in the
  package's `exports` map and a typecheck hazard. The package-root
  import path documented in the 0.3.0 ADR is now actually what works.

### Changed
- All documentation that invoked the CLI as `bunx cyanotype …` now reads
  `bunx @expelledboy/cyanotype …`. The package is scoped, so the short
  form fails to resolve. Affects `docs/attach-mode.md`, the D-030 ADR
  consequences in `docs/decisions.md`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

Consumer-driven feature batch — six additions that absorb glue Docker-attach
consumers were hand-rolling.

### Added
- `Binding.version` is now a cache key for the persisted environment. On
  re-ensure, a changed `Binding.version` stops the live containers via a
  new internal `stopAllInMeta` walk of the snapshot, deletes the metadata
  file, and re-races the start path — mirroring the dead-container
  invalidation. Pure-attach mode (no rebuild path) throws
  `{ kind: "attach_version_stale", envKey }` instead. The new
  `ComponentSnapshot.version` field is optional; absent stored versions
  skip the check, so metadata written by an older Cyanotype never
  false-invalidates (ADR D-027).
- Attach-mode image-drift detection. The Docker adapter compares the
  discovered container's image against the `Binding`'s expectation during
  `startAttach`, governed by `onImageDrift?: "warn" | "fail" | "ignore"`
  on `DockerAdapterOptions` and per-Binding via
  `AdapterConfig.compose.attach.onImageDrift` (default `"warn"`).
  `"fail"` throws `AttachImageDriftError`
  (`{ kind: "attach_image_drift", expected, actual, component }`). The
  comparison tolerates an exact match or an `@sha256:` digest suffix only
  — no looser prefix relationship (ADR D-028, D-032).
- `stack.*` observer phase covering compose-stack reconciliation:
  `stack.checking`, `stack.fresh`, `stack.stale` (carries `changedFields`),
  `stack.rebuilding`, `stack.rebuilt` (carries `durationMs`),
  `stack.attached` (carries `serviceCount`), `stack.failed` (carries
  `error`). The built-in console reporter renders the new events under a
  `"stack"` label column, parallel to `"substrate"` (ADR D-029).
- `cyanotype derive` CLI — first `bin` entry in the package. Subcommands
  `cyanotype derive compose --compose <f> --out <f|-> [--project <name>]`
  and `cyanotype derive k8s --k8s <d|f> --out <f|->`. Output is the
  binding-keyed JSON consumed at attach time. The pure library
  counterparts `deriveCompose(path, project?)` and `deriveK8s(path)` are
  also exported for in-process use. The petstore reference script is now
  a thin wrapper over the library (ADR D-030).
- `reconcileComposeStack(options) => Promise<ReconcileComposeResult>` —
  library-owned compose-stack staleness reconciliation. Options
  `{ project, composeFile, fingerprint, onStale?, observer?, stateDir?,
  force? }`. `fingerprint` is a `FingerprintSpec` — either a static
  `Array<{ name, file } | { name, value }>` or an async
  `() => Record<string, string>` for derived values. Returns
  `{ rebuilt, changedFields, durationMs }`. Emits the `stack.*` phase
  when an observer is supplied. `force: true` skips the fingerprint
  compare and goes straight to the rebuild path, emitting a `stack.stale`
  event with the synthetic marker `["<forced>"]` (ADR D-031, D-032).
- `loadDerivedCompose(path, expectedKeys)` — synchronous helper that
  reads the JSON emitted by `cyanotype derive compose`, validates each
  entry against `ComposeAdapterConfigSchema`, asserts every key in
  `expectedKeys` is present, and returns `Record<string, AdapterConfig>`.
  Three discriminated errors: `derived_compose_missing`,
  `derived_compose_invalid`, `derived_compose_missing_keys`.
  Synchronous on purpose — consumers invoke it from ensure-time setup,
  not module top level, so a missing derived file does not throw at
  import time (ADR D-032).
- New exports from `src/index.ts`: `reconcileComposeStack`,
  `loadDerivedCompose`, `deriveCompose`, `deriveK8s`,
  `computeFingerprint`, `changedFingerprintFields`,
  `readStoredFingerprint`, `writeStoredFingerprint`. New type exports:
  `ReconcileComposeOptions`, `ReconcileComposeResult`, `FingerprintSpec`,
  `FingerprintInput`, `Fingerprint`, `ImageDriftPolicy`,
  `AttachImageDriftError`, `DerivedComposeMissingError`,
  `DerivedComposeInvalidError`, `DerivedComposeMissingKeysError`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-22

Maintenance release — no changes to the published library code; CI/release
pipeline hardening and a contributor-docs fix.

### Changed
- CI and release workflows hardened: Bun package caching, a pinned Bun
  version, Node-24 action versions, a single verification pass per release
  (publish was re-running typecheck + build + tests a redundant second
  time), a concurrency guard on publish, and CHANGELOG-driven GitHub
  Release notes. CI no longer runs on push to `master` — the pre-merge
  pull-request run already covers it.
- `test-core` is now correctly documented as exercising the harness
  functionality directly (adapters, orchestrator); it was wrongly
  described as "in-memory adapter only".

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-21

Docker Compose attach adapter, framework lifecycle observer stream, and built-in console reporter.

### Added
- Docker Compose attach adapter mode (`createDockerAdapter({ mode: "attach", project })`):
  containers discovered via `com.docker.compose.project`/`.service` labels; compose service
  maps to a Cyanotype component by convention (`cyanotype.component` label), overridable
  per-Binding via the `compose.attach` config slot (`{ project, service, containerNumber,
  port, allowChaos }`). A guard blocks `createContainer`/`pull`/`remove`; `stop`/`start`
  are also blocked unless `allowChaos: true`, which enables real `docker stop`/`start`
  chaos. Services under test must publish ports to the host. The same 15-test petstore SLA
  suite runs unchanged against this fifth substrate via `CYANOTYPE_ADAPTER=docker-attach`
  (ADR D-025, D-026).
- Framework lifecycle observer stream (ADR D-024): opt-in `observer` on
  `OrchestratorOptions` receives typed `substrate.*` / `image.*` / `container.*`
  / `probe.*` / `environment.*` / `chaos.*` telemetry — including throttled
  Docker image-pull progress and per-attempt readiness polling. Zero cost when
  unset, and a throwing reporter is isolated — it never aborts provisioning.
  Reachable via `OrchestratorOptions.observer` and forwarded from
  `SharedOptions.observer` through `createSharedEnvs`.
- `createConsoleReporter()` — a built-in reporter that renders the observer
  stream as `cyanotype`-prefixed stderr lines (state glyph + component column),
  with a live per-layer image-pull progress bar on a TTY. Renders the probe
  phase so a slow custom readiness check is not silent; shortens registry
  image refs. `environment.component_ready` is emitted with component scope so
  a reporter can attribute the `ready` line to its component.
- New exports: `createConsoleReporter`, `ConsoleReporterOptions`, `Observer`,
  `ObserverEvent`, `ObserverEventData`, `ObserverEnvelope`.

### Changed
- `justfile` reorganized; contributor recipes renamed: `test-k8s` →
  `test-adapter-k8s`, `test-k8s-attach` → `test-adapter-k8s-attach`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

Initial public release. Developer preview — pre-1.0, expect minor-version breaking changes.

### Added
- Component Blueprint typed contract (API schemas + Zod event catalog)
- Binding system with adapter-pluggable substrate
- Four adapter modes: in-memory, Docker, Kubernetes deploy, Kubernetes attach
- Per-Binding adapter config via TypeScript declaration merging (ADR D-022)
- Real-chaos opt-in for K8s attach mode (ADR D-023): `allowChaos + deployment` lifts only the `scale` verb
- `startEnvironment` / `attachEnvironment` orchestrator entries
- `Runtime<E>` + typed `ChaosControls<E>` (compile-time instance args)
- Shared environment claim via `createSharedEnvs` (atomic O_CREAT|O_EXCL)
- Built-in fake helpers for petstore example (redis presence stub, nginx fail_timeout)
- 15-test petstore SLA suite passes unchanged across all four substrates

### Known limitations
- Bun runtime required (`engines.bun >=1.1.0`); test runner is `bun:test`
- Multi-port attach not yet supported (single scalar `attach.port`)
- Only HTTP and Opaque protocols implemented; TCP/gRPC/SOAP deferred
- OrbStack K8s degrades under prolonged port-forward + rollout-restart load (kind/remote recommended for sustained CI)
